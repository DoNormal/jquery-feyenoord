# jquery-feyenoord

Asynchronous JS requests for Feyenoord supporters.

## Purpose

If you’re a supporter of Feyenoord, or if you think ancient Greek heroes are pricks, you’re probably tired of calling `$.ajax()` all the time. Well, here’s the solution. This piece of code takes each Ajax-related function and wraps it inside a better Feyenoord function.

## Usage

Install using bower:

`$ bower install jquery-feyenoord`

Then, when using the [jQuery Ajax API](http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/) just replace ‘ajax’ with ‘feyenoord’ in your code, e.g. `$.feyenoord(url, options);`.
